# Set the location of the salt master server. If the master server cannot be
# resolved, then the minion will fail to start.
master: 10.10.1.5

# Explicitly declare the id for this minion to use, if left commented the id
# will be the hostname as returned by the python call: socket.getfqdn()
# Since salt uses detached ids it is possible to run multiple minions on the
# same machine but with different ids, this can be useful for salt compute
# clusters.
